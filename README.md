## Steps To Follow

- Check existing scripts in the [projects](/projects/) directory.
- **Star** this repository.
- On the [python-mini-projects](https://github.com/Python-World/python-mini-projects) repo page, click the **Fork** button.

    For example, run this command inside your terminal:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/python-mini-projects.git
    ```

    **Replace \<your-github-username\>!**

    Learn more about [forking](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) and [cloning a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
- Before you make any changes, [keep your fork in sync](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-sync-your-fork-with-the-original-git-repository/) to avoid merge conflicts:

    ```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/Python-World/python-mini-projects.git
    git fetch upstream
    git pull upstream master
    git push
    ```
    
    Alternatively, GitHub also provides syncing now - click "Fetch upstream" at the top of your repo below "Code" button.
